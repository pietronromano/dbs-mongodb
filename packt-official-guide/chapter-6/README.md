# Chapter 6: Database Operations, Monitoring, Auditing, and Compliance

This chapter covers essential MongoDB operational topics, including monitoring, auditing, backup strategies, compliance, and troubleshooting. The code and configuration snippets provided here illustrate practical usage and integration of MongoDB's operational and security features to ensure reliability, performance, and regulatory compliance in production environments.

## Key Topics

- **Monitoring**: Strategies and tools for proactive and reactive monitoring, including cluster metrics, memory, I/O, replication, and network activity.
- **Auditing**: Enabling and configuring audit logging, audit filters, and compliance strategies for sensitive data and regulated environments.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Methods for backup and restore, including Atlas, Ops Manager, Cloud Manager, and self-managed deployments.
- **Database Profiling**: Using the database profiler to analyze query performance and system activity.
- **Log Management**: Log rotation, viewing, downloading, and analysis using MongoDB and third-party tools.
- **Compliance Case Study**: Example of auditing for healthcare compliance (HIPAA).
- **Troubleshooting Auditing**: Best practices for reviewing, analyzing, and optimizing audit strategies.

# Notes on Code Snippets in Chapter 6

This folder contains a collection of MongoDB code snippets and configuration examples for Chapter 6. These files support learning and reference for operational monitoring, auditing, compliance, backup, profiling, and troubleshooting in MongoDB deployments.

## How to Read These Files

- **File Types:**
  - `.js` files: MongoDB Shell commands or JavaScript code for use in VS Code Playground or similar environments. Some are runnable directly; others are illustrative or contain placeholders.
  - `.sh` files: Shell commands for use with MongoDB Atlas CLI or API.
  - `.json` files: Example audit log entries, audit filters, and configuration patterns.
  - `.conf` files: Configuration examples for enabling features in MongoDB (audit logging, log rotation, etc.).

- **Non-Runnable Snippets:**
  - Some files (especially those with placeholder syntax, ellipses (`...`), or incomplete code) are for illustration only. They demonstrate concepts, configuration, or output structure. Use these as templates or references when designing your own queries or tool configurations.

- **Runnable Code:**
  - Most `.js` and `.sh` files are complete examples and can be run as-is in a suitable test environment. Some scripts assume the existence of certain collections or data—review and adapt as needed for your setup.

## Best Practices

- Review code before running in a production environment.
- Use these examples as learning aids or starting points for your own MongoDB projects.
- Refer to the chapter or official documentation for context on each snippet.
